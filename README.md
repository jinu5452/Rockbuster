### The Rockbuster project, designed by CareerFoundry, investigated the market viability of shifting the movie rental business into a streaming service.  

##### **PostgreSQL Tableau  Excel**

##### **Key Questions:**  
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
-  Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
-  Where are customers with a high l ifetime value based?
-  Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

##### **Recommendations:**  
- **Focus on the Asian Market**: Asia constitutes 43% of the company's revenue, with India, China, and Japan being among the top 5 countries. These nations are particularly significant, making Asia a pivotal region for the company.
- **Marketing through Existing Customers**: The company has already expanded its presence to 597 cities worldwide, yet each city has only one customer. The transition to a streaming service enhances accessibility for customers. By leveraging marketing strategies targeting existing customers, introducing just one additional customer per city would result in a 100% growth for the company.
- **Continued Expansion of Title Library**: The company currently holds a library of 1,000 titles. While this number may seem modest compared to leaders in the streaming service market, it is sufficiently competitive. However, as observed in the film sales histogram, a substantial number of titles contribute significantly to revenue. Therefore, a continual expansion of the title library is recommended.
